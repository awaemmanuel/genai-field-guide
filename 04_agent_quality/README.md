# 04: Agent Quality

This module focuses on the critical aspects of ensuring quality in AI agents, covering both **Observability** and **Evaluation**. It explores how to gain deep insights into an agent's behavior and how to systematically assess its performance.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Observability:** Understanding an agent's internal workings through Logs, Traces, and Metrics.
*   **Evaluation:** Methods for scoring agent response quality and tool usage, including LLM-as-a-Judge and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approaches.

## Architectural Patterns:

This module will contain architectural patterns demonstrating best practices for:

*   Integrating comprehensive logging and tracing into agentic workflows.
*   Collecting and analyzing key performance metrics for agents.
*   Implementing automated and human-assisted evaluation frameworks.
